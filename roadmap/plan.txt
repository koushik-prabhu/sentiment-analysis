Lets say I am a phone brand company, everytime we launch a new phone we need to track the reviews on reddit. We need to categorise the comments, extract positive negative comments etc. This will help us to improve and bring updates on our future phones. Also we can keep track of our rivals

That's a fantastic idea! It perfectly aligns with how companies can leverage data to enhance their products and stay competitive.

Here’s a detailed roadmap for your project:
Project: Phone Brand Review Tracker on Reddit
Goal:
Track customer feedback and reviews on Reddit after launching a new phone.
Categorize the feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.
Extract key insights to improve future phones and software updates.
Track competitor feedback for comparison.
1. Extract Data from Reddit
Objective: Pull posts and comments from subreddits like r/smartphones, r/technology, or phone-specific communities (r/OnePlus, r/Samsung).

Approach:

Scrape posts and comments mentioning the newly launched phone and competitors (e.g., "iPhone 14", "Samsung Galaxy S23").
Filter by relevant keywords related to your phone model.
Pull data over time (e.g., a few weeks or months post-launch).
Implementation: Use the Reddit API with PRAW to extract relevant data.

python
Copy code
import praw

# Reddit API setup
reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
    user_agent='phone_review_tracker/0.1 by u/your_username'
)

keywords = ['iPhone 14', 'Samsung Galaxy S23', 'OnePlus 11']
subreddit = reddit.subreddit('smartphones')

for post in subreddit.search(' OR '.join(keywords), limit=100):
    print(post.title, post.score, post.url)
2. Categorize Comments (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
Objective: Perform sentiment analysis on the posts/comments to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.

Approach:

Preprocess the text by removing unnecessary characters (stop words, punctuation).
Use a sentiment analysis tool like VADER or TextBlob to assign sentiment scores to each comment/post.
Categorize each comment based on the sentiment score (positive, negative, neutral).
Implementation:

python
Copy code
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

def get_sentiment(text):
    sentiment = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)
    if sentiment['compound'] >= 0.05:
        return 'positive'
    elif sentiment['compound'] <= -0.05:
        return 'negative'
    else:
        return 'neutral'

for post in subreddit.search(' OR '.join(keywords), limit=100):
    sentiment = get_sentiment(post.title)
    print(f"Title: {post.title}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
3. Extract Key Topics (Common Features/Complaints)
Objective: Identify key aspects of the phone being discussed, such as performance, battery life, camera quality, etc.

Approach:

Perform keyword extraction to find common words or topics in the comments.
Use libraries like spaCy or nltk to identify frequently discussed features.
Build word clouds or bar charts to visualize the most talked-about features.
Implementation:

python
Copy code
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

def extract_keywords(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    keywords = [token.text for token in doc if not token.is_stop and token.is_alpha]
    return keywords

for post in subreddit.search(' OR '.join(keywords), limit=100):
    keywords = extract_keywords(post.title)
    print(f"Keywords: {keywords}")
4. Track Competitor Feedback
Objective: Compare your phone's feedback with that of your competitors.
Approach:
Repeat the same process of extracting data and performing sentiment analysis on competitors' phones.
Build a comparison dashboard showing how your phone fares against competitors across features (e.g., battery life, camera, price).
Implementation: Store both your product’s and competitors’ data in AWS (S3 or RDS) for future analysis.
5. Automate the Pipeline with Apache Airflow
Objective: Schedule the entire process to run automatically and frequently (e.g., daily or weekly) after a new phone launch.
Approach:
Set up a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in Airflow to define each task (extract, transform, load).
Automate the data extraction, sentiment analysis, and loading into AWS.
Implementation:
python
Copy code
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def extract_data():
    # Reddit data extraction logic
    pass

def transform_data():
    # Sentiment analysis and categorization logic
    pass

def load_data():
    # Load processed data into AWS (S3 or RDS)
    pass

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'start_date': datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    'retries': 1
}

dag = DAG('phone_review_tracker', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval='@daily')

t1 = PythonOperator(task_id='extract_data', python_callable=extract_data, dag=dag)
t2 = PythonOperator(task_id='transform_data', python_callable=transform_data, dag=dag)
t3 = PythonOperator(task_id='load_data', python_callable=load_data, dag=dag)

t1 >> t2 >> t3
6. Visualize and Analyze Feedback Trends
Objective: Provide visualizations to help the marketing/product teams understand trends over time.
Approach:
Use AWS QuickSight, Tableau, or Power BI to build dashboards that show:
Sentiment trends over time.
Key features being discussed (positive and negative).
Comparison with competitor products.
Create interactive reports that allow teams to dig into specific features or posts.
Impact of the Project:
Product Development: Your teams can focus on fixing the most mentioned issues in the next phone update or model (e.g., improving battery life or fixing camera issues).
Competitive Analysis: By tracking competitors, you can gain insights into where their products are succeeding or failing, and strategically align your next phone launch to outperform them.
Customer Satisfaction: By proactively tracking sentiment, you can make data-driven decisions to boost customer satisfaction and reduce potential issues.
